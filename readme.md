# PONG: The Childhood Game

Pong is the game that you used to play in your childhood. That game is back with a lot of enhancements and a lot more fun.

## Description
I have created this game using Python and its GUI library: Kivy. The documentation of the Kivy library recommends building this game to learn basic concepts for making GUI-based applications using Kivy. Therefore, I have built this game while learning Kivy. I have just done some enhancements to the game by adding sounds, images, etc. That's why I have named this game version 2.0 of Pong.

## Installation

It's easy, download the **apk** file then install it on your android smartphone.

**Note:** I do not have a Google Developer Account, that's why when you will install this apk, you may get a *Play Protect* prompt from Google Play Store telling you that it doesn't recognize this game's developer. Just click on **Install Anyway** button to install the apk, this game will not cause any problem to your device.  

HAVE FUN !!
